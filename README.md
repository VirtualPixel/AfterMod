# After Mod Project

**What is The After?**

The After is a dimension that crosses the border between the living and the dead. Create an After portal by smelting soul sand and making a portal out of refined soul sand, but be careful. 
The living aren't meant to visit the land of the passed on - and the creatures who inhabit this realm want to keep it that way. This realm is populated with a familiar, yet uncomfortable world and atmosphere. 
There's new goals, achievements, mobs, items, armor, ores, and plenty more to explore. Just remember not to get too comfortable in this world.
